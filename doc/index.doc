\section mooch_intro_sec Introduction

MOOCHO (Multifunctional Object-Oriented arCHitecture for Optimization) is
designed to solve large-scale, equality and inequality nonlinearly
constrained, non-convex optimization problems (i.e. nonlinear programs) using
reduced-space successive quadratic programming (SQP) methods.  The most
general form of the optimization problem that can be solved is:

\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{minimize}   &  & f(x) \\
\mbox{subject to} &  & c(x) = 0 \\
                  &  & x_L \leq x    \leq x_U
\end{array}
\f]

where \f$x\in\Re^n\f$ the vector of optimization variables,
\f$f(x)\in\Re^n\rightarrow\Re\f$ is the nonlinear scalar objective function,
\f$c(x)=0\f$ (where \f$c(x)\in\Re^n\rightarrow\Re^m\f$) are the nonlinear
constraints, and \f$x_L\f$ and \f$x_U\f$ are the upper and lower bounds on the
variables.  The current algorithms in MOOCHO are well suited to solving
optimization problems with massive numbers of unknown variables and equations
but few so-called degrees of optimization freedom (i.e. the degrees of freedom
= the number of variables minus the number of equality constraints =
\f$n-m\f$).  Various line-search based globalization methods are available,
including exact penalty functions and a form of the filter method.  Many of
the algorithms in MOOCHO are provably locally and globally convergent for a
wide class of problems in theory but in practice the behavior and the
performance of the algorithms varies greatly from problem to problem.

MOOCHO was initially developed to solve general sparse optimization problems
where there is no clear distinction between state variables and optimization
parameters.  For these types of problems a serial sparse direct solver must be
used (i.e. using MA28) to find a square basis that is needed for the variable
reduction decompositions that are current supported.

More recently, MOOCHO has been interfaced through <tt>%Thyra</tt> and the
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface to address very large-scale,
massively parallel, simulation-constrained optimization problems that take the
form:

\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{minimize}   &  & f(x_D,x_I) \\
\mbox{subject to} &  & c(x_D,x_I) = 0 \\
                  &  & x_{D,L} \leq x_D \leq x_{D,U} \\
                  &  & x_{I,L} \leq x_I \leq x_{I,U}
\end{array}
\f]

where \f$x_D\in\Re^{m}\f$ are the "dependent" state variables,
\f$x_I\in\Re^{n-m}\f$ are the "independent" optimization parameters and
\f$c(x_D,x_I)=0\f$ are the discrete nonlinear state simulation equations.
Here the state Jacobian \f$\frac{\partial c}{\partial x_D}\f$ must be square
and nonsingular and the partitioning of \f$x=\left[\begin{array}{cc} x_D^T &
x_I^T \end{array}\right]^T\f$ into state variables \f$x_D\f$ and optimization
variables \f$x_I\f$ must be known <em>a priori</em> and this partitioning can
not change during a solve.  Warning, the <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt>
interface uses a overlapping and inconsistent set set of names for the
variables and the problem functions.  All of the functionality needed for
MOOCHO to solve a simulation-constrained optimization problem can be specified
through sub-classing the <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface, and related
<tt>%Thyra</tt> interfaces.  Epetra-based applications can instead implement
the <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface and never need to work with
%Thyra directly except in trivial and transparent ways.

For simulation-constrained optimization problems, MOOCHO can utilize the full
power of the massively parallel iterative linear solvers and preconditioners
available in Trilinos through %Thyra through the <tt>Stratimikos</tt> package
by just flipping a few switches in a parameter list.  These include all of the
direct solves in Amesos, the preconditioners in Ifpack and ML, and the
iterative Krylov solvers in AztecOO and Belos (which is not being released but
is available in the development version of Trilinos).  For small to moderate
numbers of optimization parameters, the only bottleneck to parallel
scalability is the linear solver used to solve linear systems involving the
state Jacobian \f$\frac{\partial c}{\partial x_D}\f$.  The reduced-space SQP
algorithms in MOOCHO itself exhibit extremely good parallel scalability.  The
parallel scalability of the linear solvers is controlled by the simulation
application and the Trilinos linear solvers and preconditioners themselves.
Typically, the parallel scalability is limited by the preconditioners as the
problem is partitioned to more and more processes.

MOOCHO also includes a minimally invasive mode for reduced-space SQP where the
simulator application only needs to compute the objective and constraint
functions \f$f(x_D,x_I)\in\Re^{n}\rightarrow\Re\f$ and
\f$c(x_D,x_I)\in\Re^{n}\rightarrow\Re^{m}\f$ and solve only forward linear
systems involving \f$\frac{\partial c}{\partial x_D}\f$.  All other
derivatives can be approximated with directional finite differences but any
exact derivatives that can be computed by the application are happily accepted
and fully utilized by MOOCHO through the <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt>
interface.

\section moocho_quickstart_sec MOOCHO Quickstart

In order to get started using MOOCHO to solve your NLPs you must first build
MOOCHO as part of Trilinos and install it.  When MOOCHO is installed with
Trilinos, several complete examples are also installed that show how to define
NLPs, compile and link against the installed headers and libraries, and how to
run the MOOCHO solvers.

Below, we briefly describe \ref moocho_configure_install_sec, \ref
moocho_quickstart_solving_sec, and accessing the \ref
moocho_installed_examples_sec.

\subsection moocho_configure_install_sec Configuring, Building, and Installing MOOCHO

Complete details on the configuration, building, and installation of Trilinos
are described in the <a
href="../../../../doc/UserGuide/TrilinosUserGuide.pdf">Trilinos Users
Guide</a>.  However, here we give a quick overview of one such installation.

Here we describe the configuration, build, and installation process for a
directory structure that looks like:

\verbatim

  $TRILINOS_BASE_DIR
   |
   |-- Trilinos
   |
    -- BUILDS
        |
         -- DEBUG

\endverbatim

where <tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR</tt> is some base directory such as
<tt>TRILINOS_BASE_DIR=$HOME/Trilinos.base</tt>.  However, in general, the
build directory (show as <tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/BUILDS/DEBUG</tt> above) can
be any directory you want but should not be the same as the base directory for
Trilinos.  In the most general case, we will assume that
<tt>$TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR</tt> is the base build directory; in this section, we
assume that <tt>TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR=$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/BUILDS/DEBUG</tt>.  The
Trilinos Users Guide might still recommend that you create the build
directory from within the main Trilinos source directory tree
(i.e. <tt>Trilinos/DEBUG</tt>) but we recommend against this practice and the
build system supports the more general case described here just as well.

Here are the steps needed to configure, build, and install MOOCHO along with
the rest of Trilinos:

<ol>

<li><b>Obtain a source tree for Trilinos</b>

Once you have created the base directory <tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR</tt> you need
to get a copy of the Trilinos source.

If you have CVS access you can obtain the version of the day through the main
development trunk or can check out a specific tagged release.  For example, to
obtain the version of the day you would perform:

\verbatim

  cd $TRILINOS_BASE_DIR
  cvs -d :ext:userid@software.sandia.gov:/space/CVS co Trilinos

\endverbatim

where <tt>userid</tt> is your user ID on the CVS server.  For further details
on working with CVS access to Trilinos, see the <a
href="../../../../doc/DevGuide/TrilinosDevGuide.pdf">Trilinos Developers
Guide</a>.

If you do not have CVS access you can obtain a tar ball for a release of
Trilinos from the <a
href="http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/downloads">Trilinos Releases
Download Page</a>.  Once you have the tar ball, you can expand it into the
directory <tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR</tt> as follows:

\verbatim

  cd $TRILINOS_BASE_DIR
  tar -xzvf ~/trilnos-7.0.x.tar.gz

\endverbatim

where <tt>7.0.x</tt> is some minor release number of Trilinos; hopefully the
most current version.  Note that when building form a tarball, the base
directly is likely to be called something like <tt>trilinos-7.0.x</tt> instead
of just the base directory name <tt>Trilinos</tt> as is assumed in this
document.

<li><b>Create the build base directory</b>

After you have a copy of the Trilinos source tree in
<tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/Trilinos</tt>, you need to create the base build
directory.  Here, we assume that you will create the build directory
<tt>$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/BUILDS/DEBUG</tt> as follows:

\verbatim

  cd $TRILINOS_BASE_DIR
  mkdir BUILDS
  mkdir BUILDS/DEBUG

\endverbatim

<li><b>Create a configuration script</b>

Once you have the Trilinos source code and have created a base build
directory, you need to create a configuration script for Trilinos.  By far the
hardest part of building and installing Trilinos is figuring out how to write
the configuration script that will work for the system that you are on and
includes the packages and extra options that you need.  The best place to find
example configure scripts that at least have a chance of being correct on
specific systems is to look at Trilinos test harness scripts in the directory:

\verbatim

  Trilinos/commonTools/test/harness/invoke-configure

\endverbatim

Older scripts that have worked on a wider variety of systems in the past for
different sets of packages can be found in the directory:

\verbatim

  Trilinos/sampleScripts

\endverbatim

Warning!  The scripts in <tt>Trilinos/sampleScripts</tt> are likely to be
currently broken for even the same systems for which they where developed.
These scripts really only provide ideas for different combinations of options
to try to get a configure script to work on your system.

Below is perhaps one of the simplest configure scripts that might get Trilinos
to build on a GCC/Linux based platform with MOOCHO support correctly and with
enough capability to be useful for initial development purposes:

\verbatim

$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/Trilinos/configure \
--prefix=$TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR \
--with-gnumake \
--enable-export-makefiles \
--with-cflags="-g -O0 -ansi -Wall" \
--with-cxxflags="-g -O0 -ansi -Wall -pedantic" \
--enable-teuchos-extended --enable-teuchos-debug --enable-teuchos-abc \
--enable-thyra \
--enable-epetraext \
--enable-stratimikos \
--enable-moocho

\endverbatim

A word of caution is in order about the above simple configure script; The
above script assumes that certain packages will be turned on by default (such
as %Epetra, %Amesos, %AztecOO, %Ifpack, and %ML) and other will be turned on
automatically by the presence of other enables.  While this should work
correctly for many different possible combinations of enables and disables,
there are many configurations that will not work just due to faults in logic
and inadequate testing of all of the possible options.  When in doubt, be
explicit about what you enable and be weary about selectively disabling
certain packages and subpackages.

Below is an example of a more compliicated configure script that might be used
to configure Trilinos with MOOCHO support and a Linux system with gcc with
more capabilities based on some third-party libraries (but the script might
not actually work on any actual computer on Earth):

\verbatim

$TRILINOS_BASE_DIR/Trilinos/configure \
--prefix=$TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR \
--with-install="/usr/bin/install -p" \
--with-gnumake \
--enable-export-makefiles \
--with-cflags="-g -O0 -ansi -Wall" \
--with-cxxflags="-g -O0 -ansi -Wall -ftrapv -pedantic -Wconversion" \
--enable-mpi --with-mpi-compilers \
--with-incdirs="-I${HOME}/include" \
--with-ldflags="-L${HOME}/lib/LINUX_MPI" \
--with-libs="-ldscpack -lumfpack -lamd -lparmetis-3.1 -lmetis-4.0 -lskit" \
--with-blas=-lblas \
--with-lapack=-lapack \
--with-flibs="-lg2c" \
--disable-default-packages \
--enable-teuchos --enable-teuchos-extended --disable-teuchos-complex \
  --enable-teuchos-abc --enable-teuchos-debug \
--enable-thyra \
--enable-epetra \
--enable-triutils \
--enable-epetraext \
--enable-amesos --enable-amesos-umfpack --enable-amesos-dscpack \
--enable-aztecoo \
--enable-ifpack --enable-ifpack-metis --enable-ifpack-sparskit \
--enable-ml --with-ml_metis --with-ml_parmetis3x \
--enable-stratimikos \
--enable-moocho

\endverbatim

The above script is almost completely platform dependent in most cases, except
for everything below <tt>--disable-default-packages</tt> for enable options
for individual packages.  A few points about the above configure script are
worth mentioning.  First, some of the package enable options such as
<tt>--enable-epetra</tt> should be unnecessary once other options such as
<tt>--enable-epetraext</tt> are included but to be safe it is a good idea to
be explicit about what packages to build in case the default built-in
top-level configure logic does not handle the dependencies correctly.  Second,
it is a good idea to include the options <tt>--enable-teuchos-debug</tt> and
<tt>--enable-teuchos-abc</tt> when you first start working with Trilinos to
help catch coding errors on your part (and perhaps on the part of Trilinos
developers).  Third, the above script shows enabled support for several
third-party libraries such as UMFPACK, DSCPACK, SparseKit, and Metis.  You are
responsible for installing these third party libraries yourself if you want
the extra capabilities that they enable.  Otherwise, to get started, a simpler
script, such as shown above, can be used to get started with Trilinos/MOOCHO.

As a final step, you can copy the contents of the configure invocation command
(examples shown above) into a script called <tt>do-configure</tt> and make the
script executable which is assumed below.

<li><b>Configure, build, and install Trilinos</b>

Once you have a configure script, you can try to configure and build Trilinos
as follows:

\verbatim

  cd $TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR
  ./do-configure
  make
  make install

\endverbatim

If a problem does occur, it usually occurs during configuration.  Often trial
and error is required to get the configuration to complete successfully.

Once the Trilinos build completes (which can take hours on a slower machine if
a lot of packages are enabled) you should test Trilinos using something like:

\verbatim

  make runtest-mpi TRILINOS_MPI_GO="mpirun -np "

\endverbatim

If MPI is not enabled, you run run the serial test suite as:

\verbatim

  make runtest-serial

\endverbatim

Some of the tests in the test suite may fail if you have not enabled
everything and this is okay.  Once you feel confident that the build has
completed correctly, you can install Trilinos as follows:

\verbatim

  make install

\endverbatim

If everything goes smoothly, then Trilinos will be installed with the
following directory structure:

\verbatim

  $TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR
   |
   |-- examples
   |
   |-- include
   |
   |-- libs
   |
    -- tools

\endverbatim

Once the install competes, you can move on to building and running the
installed MOOCHO examples as described in the next section.

</ol>

\subsection moocho_installed_examples_sec Installed Optimization Examples

When the configure option <tt>--enable-export-makefiles</tt> is included, a
set of examples are installed in the directory specified by
<tt>--prefix=$TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR</tt> and the directory structure will look
something like:

\verbatim

  $TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR
   |
   |-- examples
   |    |
   |     -- moocho
   |         |
   |         |-- NLPWBCounterExample
   |         |
   |         |-- ExampleNLPBanded
   |         |
   |         |-- thyra
   |              |
   |              |-- NLPThyraEpetraModelEval4DOpt
   |              |
   |               -- NLPThyraEpetraAdvDiffReactOpt
   |
    -- tools
        |
         -- moocho

\endverbatim

Note that the directory <tt>$TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR/examples/moocho/thyra</tt>
will not be installed if <tt>--enable-export-makefiles</tt> is not included
(or is disabled) or if <tt>--enable-thyra</tt> is missing or
<tt>--disable-moocho-thyra</tt> is specified at configure time.  Also, none of
the examples will be installed if the examples are disabled with
<tt>--disable-examples</tt>.

Each installed example contains a simple makefile that is ready to build each
of the examples and to demonstrate several important features of MOOCHO.  Each
makefile shows how to compile and link against the installed header files and
libraries.  These makefiles use the Trilinos export makefile system to make it
easy to get all of the compiler and linker options and get the right libraries
in the build process.  The user is encouraged to copy these examples to their
own directories and modify them to solve their NLPs.

Specific examples are explained below but we first go through the common
features of these examples here for one of the <tt>%Thyra::%ModelEvaluator
examples</tt>.

One common feature of all of the installed examples is the makefile that is
generated.  For the <tt>NLPWBCounterExample</tt> example (that is described in
the section \ref moocho_explicit_nlps_examples_sec) the makefile looks like:

<!-- The below is from the base path ../example added to the
EXAMPLE_PATH doxygen variable -->
\anchor moocho_Example_Makefile_anchor
\verbinclude NLPWBCounterExample/external/Makefile.external.sample

By using the macros starting with <tt>MOOCHO_</tt> one is guaranteed that the
same compiler with the same options are used to build the client's code that
were used to build Trilinos.  Of particular importance are the macros
<tt>MOOCHO_CXX</tt>, <tt>MOOCHO_DEFS</tt>, <tt>MOOCHO_CPPFLAGS</tt>, and
<tt>MOOCHO_CXXLD</tt> since these ensure that the same C++ compiler and the
same <tt>-D</tt> C/C++ preprocessor definitions are used.  These are critical
to compiling compatible code in many cases.  The macro <tt>MOOCHO_LIBS</tt>
contain all of the libraries needed to link executables and they include all
of the libraries in their lower-level dependent Trilinos packages.  For
example, you don't explicitly see the libraries for say %Teuchos, but you can
be sure that they are there.

This makefile gets created with the following lines commented in or out
depending on if <tt>--enable-gnumake</tt> was specified or not when Trilinos
was configured:

<!-- The below is from the base path ../thyra/example added to the
EXAMPLE_PATH doxygen variable -->
\dontinclude NLPWBCounterExample/external/Makefile.external.sample
\skip For platforms where perl and GNUMake are used
\until LOCAL_LINK_FLAGS = $(_LOCAL_LINK_FLAGS)

In the above example, support for GNU Make is enabled which results in scripts
being called to clean up the list of libraries and which may have duplicate
entries otherwise.

A few different installed NLP examples are described in the following
sections.

\subsection moocho_quickstart_solving_sec Running MOOCHO to Solve Optimization Problems

Once an NLP is defined and a driver program is in place (see the above driver
programs), MOOCHO can then be run to try to solve the optimization problem.
When solving an NLP based on
<tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPSerialPreprocessExplJac</tt> one should directly use
the solver class <tt>MoochoPack::MoochoSolver</tt>.  However, when using an
NLP based on <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt>, then the solver class
<tt>MoochoPack::ThyraModelEvaluatorSolver</tt> should be used.  The use of
these two classes are demonstrated in the files ??? and ??? respectively.

ToDo: Finish this section!

\section moocho_nlps_sec Representing Nonlinear Programs for MOOCHO to Solve

As described above, there are two well supported tracts to developing concrete
NLP subclasses to be used with MOOCHO.  The first type are general NLPs with
explicit derivative components that can only be solved in serial.  The second
type are simulation-constrained NLPs that can be solved on massively parallel
computers by utilizing preconditioned iterative linear solvers.

\subsection moocho_explicit_nlps_sec Representing General Serial NLPs with Explicit Jacobian Entries

<b>Warning!</b> This NLP interface is going to most likely change before the
next major release of Trilinos.  Therefore, it is recommended that users
derive their NLPs from the %Thyra-based simulation-constrained interfaces
described in the next section \ref moocho_simulation_constrained_nlps_sec.

One type of NLP that MOOCHO can solve are general NLPs where there are
explicit gradient and Jacobian entries available.  This means that the
gradient of the objective function \f$\nabla f\f$ must be available in vector
coefficient form and the gradient of the constraints matrix \f$\nabla c\f$
(i.e. the rectangular Jacobian \f$\frac{\partial c}{\partial x}=\nabla c^T\f$)
must be available in sparse matrix form.  In this type of problem, a basis
matrix for the constraints need not be known <i>a priori</i> but this requires
the availability of a linear direct solver that can be used to find a square
nonsingular basis from a rectangular matrix.  There are a few direct solvers
available that could in principle find a square basis given a rectangular
input matrix but MOOCHO only currently contains wrappers for LAPACK
(i.e. dense factorization using <tt>DEGETRF(...)</tt>) and the Harwell
Subroutine Library (HSL) routine MA28.  The MA28 routine is the only viable
option currently supported for large sparse linear systems.  In the past,
other direct solvers have been experimented with and an ambitious user can
provide support for any direct solver they would like (with the ability to
find a square basis) by providing an implementation of the
<tt>AbstractLinAlgPack::DirectSparseSolver</tt> interface.  If your NLP can
also provide explicit objective function gradients, then concrete subclasses
should derive from the <tt>NLPInterfacePack::NLPSerialPreprocessExplJac</tt>
subclass.

\subsection moocho_simulation_constrained_nlps_sec Representing Simulation-Constrained Parallel NLPs through Thyra

Another type of NLP that can be solved using MOOCHO are simulation-constrained
NLPs where the basis section is known up front.  For these types of NLPs, it
is recommended that the NLP be specified through the
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface and this provides access to a
significant linear solver capability through Trilinos.  These types of NLPs
can be solved in single program multiple data (SPMD) mode in parallel on a
massively parallel computer.

The <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface uses a different notation than
the standard MOOCHO NLP notation.  The model evaluator notation is:


\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{minimize}   &  & g(x,p) \\
\mbox{subject to} &  & f(x,p) = 0 \\
                  &  & x_L \leq x    \leq x_U \\
                  &  & p_L \leq p    \leq p_U
\end{array}
\f]

where \f$x\in\Re^{n_x}\f$ are the state variables, \f$p\in\Re^{n_p}\f$ are the
optimization parameters and \f$f(x,p)=0\f$ are the discrete nonlinear state
simulation equations.  Here the state Jacobian \f$\frac{\partial f}{\partial
x}\f$ must be square and nonsingular.  The partitioning of variables into
state variables \f$x\f$ and optimization variables \f$p\f$ must be known <em>a
priori</em> and this partitioning can not change during a solve.

Comparing the MOOCHO notation for optimization problems using variable
decomposition methods which is

\f[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\mbox{minimize}   &  & f(x_D,x_I) \\
\mbox{subject to} &  & c(x_D,x_I) = 0 \\
                  &  & x_{D,L} \leq x_D \leq x_{D,U} \\
                  &  & x_{I,L} \leq x_I \leq x_{I,U}
\end{array}
\f]

we can see the mapping between the MOOCHO notation and the
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> notation as summarized in the following table:

<table>

<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> for simulation-constrained optimization
problems.  </caption>

<tr> <td><b>MOOCHO Notation</b></td> <td><b><tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> Notation</b></td>
<td><b><tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> Description</b></td> </tr>

</table>

It is unfortunate that the notation used with the Model Evaluator interfaces
and software are different than those used by MOOCHO.  The reason for this
change in notation is that the Model Evaluator had to first appeal to the
forward solve community where \f$f(x,p)=0\f$ is the standard notation for the
parameterized state equation and changing the notation of all of MOOCHO after
the fact to match this would be very tedious to perform.  We can only hope
that the user can keep the above mapping of notation straight between MOOCHO
and the Model Evaluator.

Currently, and more so in the near future, a great deal of capability will be
automatically available when a user provides an implementation of the
<tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface (as shown in the section \ref
moocho_simulation_constrained_nlps_examples_sec).  For these types of NLPs, a
great deal of linear solver capability is available through the linear solver
and preconditioners wrappers in the <a
href="../../../stratimikos/doc/html/index.html">Stratimikos</a> package.  In
addition, the application will also have access to many other nonlinear
algorithms provided in Trilinos (see the Trilinos packages NOX, LOCA, and
Rythmos).

\section moocho_dependencies_sec Other Trilinos Packages on which MOOCHO Directly Depends

%MOOCHO has direct dependencies on the following Trilinos packages:

<ul>

<li><b><a href="../../../teuchos/doc/html/index.html">teuchos</a></b>: This
package supplies basic utility classes such as <tt>Teuchos::RefCountPtr</tt>
and <tt>Teuchos::BLAS</tt> that %MOOCHO software is dependent on.

<li><b><a href="../../../rtop/doc/html/index.html">rtop</a></b>: This package
supplies the basic interfaces for vector reduction/transformation operators as
well as support code and a library of pre-written RTOp subclasses.  Much of
the software in MOOCHO depends on this code.

</ul>

%MOOCHO also optionally directly depends on the following Trilinos packages:

<ul>

<li><b><a href="../../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">thyra</a></b>: This
package supplies interfaces and support software for SPMD and other types of
computing platforms and defines the interface <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt>
for simulation-constrained optimization that MOOCHO can use to define NLPs.
See the option <tt>--enable-moocho-thyra</tt> described in the section \ref
moocho_configuration_sec.

<li><b><a href="../../../epetraext/doc/html/index.html">epetraext</a></b>:
This package provides an Epetra-specific interface for the model evaluator
called <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> and contains some concrete examples
that are used by MOOCHO.

<li><b><a href="../../../stratimikos/doc/html/index.html">stratimikos</a></b>:
This package supplies %Thyra-based wrappers for several serial direct and
massively parallel iterative linear solvers and preconditioners.

</ul>

\section moocho_configuration_sec Configuration of the MOOCHO Package

The %MOOCHO package's <tt>configure</tt> script (which should be called from
the base Trilinos-level configure script) responds to a number of options that
affect the code that is built and what code is installed.

Some of the more important configuration options are:

<ul>

<li><b><tt>--enable-moocho</tt></b>: Causes the %MOOCHO package and all
of its dependent packages to be enabled and built.  Without this option, there
will be no %MOOCHO header files or libraries included in the installation of
Trilinos (i.e. using <tt>make install</tt>).

<li><b><tt>--enable-moocho-ma28</tt></b>: Causes the %MOOCHO package to
compile in support for the sparse solver HSL MA28.  Currently, this is the
only supported direct solver for large sparse systems where the basis matrix
is not know up front.

<li><b><tt>--enable-moocho-thyra</tt></b>: Causes the %MOOCHO package to
compile in support for <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> to support massively
parallel simulation-constrained optimization.  Note that this option will be
turned on by default if <tt>--enable-moocho</tt> and <tt>--enable-thyra</tt>
are both included.

<li><b><tt>--enable-moocho-stratimikos</tt></b>: Causes the examples in the
%MOOCHO package to compile in support for the linear solver wrappers through
the %Stratimikos package.  None of the software in the %MOOCHO library has any
dependence on %Stratimikos but none of the examples that %Thyra depend on it
will be compiled or installed if this option is not included.  Note that this
option will be turned on by default if <tt>--enable-moocho</tt> and
<tt>--enable-stratimikos</tt> are both included.  This option is only
meaningful if %Thyra support is enabled.

<li><b><tt>--enable-export-makefiles</tt></b>: Causes the
installation of the %MOOCHO package (an other Trilinos packages) to have the
makefile fragments <tt>Makefile.export.moocho</tt> and
<tt>Makefile.export.moocho.macros</tt> installed in the installation directory
<tt>$TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR/include</tt> for use by external makefiles (see the
section \ref moocho_explicit_nlps_examples_sec).  This option also causes the
examples described in the section \ref
moocho_simulation_constrained_nlps_examples_sec to be installed.

</ul>

See the output from <tt>Trilinos/pacakges/moocho/configure --help</tt> for a
complete listing of all of the configure options for which MOOCHO responds.

The %MOOCHO package is also affected by configure options passed to other
packages.  Here are some of of these options:

<ul>

<li><b><tt>--enable-teuchos-debug</tt></b>: Causes a great deal of error
checking code to be added to MOOCHO software.

<li><b><tt>--enable-thyra</tt></b>: Enables all Thyra-based software by
default and enables the MOOCHO/Thyra adapters by default.

<li><b><tt>--enable-epetraext-thyra</tt></b>: Causes the examples that depend
on <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> described in the section \ref
moocho_simulation_constrained_nlps_examples_sec to be compiled and installed.
Note that this is enabled by default if <tt>--enable-thyra</tt> and
<tt>--enable-epetraext</tt> are both included.

<li><b><tt>--enable-stratimikos</tt></b>: Enables support for Stratimikos.
Note that this automatically enables <tt>--enable-moocho-stratimikos</tt> by
default.

<li><b><tt>--enable-amesos</tt></b>: Enables support for the Amesos linear
solvers that can be access through Stratimikos.

<li><b><tt>--enable-aztecoo</tt></b>: Enables support for the AztecOO linear
solvers that can be access through Stratimikos.

<li><b><tt>--enable-belos</tt></b>: Enables support for the Belos linear
solvers that can be access through Stratimikos.

<li><b><tt>--enable-ifpack</tt></b>: Enables support for the Ifpack
preconditioners that can be access through Stratimikos.

<li><b><tt>--enable-ml</tt></b>: Enables support for the ML preconditioners
that can be access through Stratimikos.

</ul>

Note that the above options will not be listed by
<tt>Trilinos/packages/moocho/configure --help</tt> but instead are listed by
<tt>Trilinos/configure --help=recursive</tt>.
