/** @name namespace DenseLinAlgPack.

Dense 1-D vectors are abstracted by two classes, \ref{DVector} and \ref{DVectorSlice}.
#DVector# is a storage type that dynamically allocates memory for a sequential array of
elements and provides access to those elements in a variety of way.  DVectorSlice is a
class that is used to provide a view of an array of elements that are spaced at regular
intervals such as BLAS vectors.  A #DVectorSlice# object can represent an entire vector,
a subregion of a vector, or a row or column or diagonal of a rectangular BLAS compatable
matrix.  In addition #DVectorSlice# objects can be constructed a views of raw sequential
(C++ or Fortran compatible) arrays and thus can coexist with other packages efficiently.

BLAS compatible 2-D matrices are abstracted by the types \ref{DMatrix} and
\ref{DMatrixSlice}.  These classes parallel #DVector# and #DVectorSlice# as #DMatrix#
is a storage type that dynamically allocates memory and #DMatrixSlice# provides BLAS
compatible views of rectangular 2-D matrices or subregions of matrices.

@memo
Uses Packages Misc, BLAS_Cpp.\\
This is a package of abstract data types and operations for dense linear algebra
using real double precision floating point values.
Included are vector and matrix types meant to abstract dense linear algebra
that is BLAS compatable.
